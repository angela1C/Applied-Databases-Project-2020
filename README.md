# Applied Databases project.

This repository contains some of my work for the Applied Databases project submitted as part of the requirement for the Applied Databases module at GMIT as part of the Higher Diploma in Computing and Data Analytics programme.

The actual project was submitted through the college Moodle platform as a zip file. 

The Applied Databases module provided a primer on databases with a focus on data analysis; CRUD ( Creation, Retrieval, Update and Deletion) of both structured and unstructured data for a number of modern database systems and architectures; Topics on Relational databases, NoSQL databases, databases interfaces and database logic.

The project had four different sections.
1. Working with a relational database and writing MySQL queries
2. Working with a non-relational database and writing MongoDb queries.
3. Writing a Python application that allows a user to perform CRUD operations on both relational and non-relational databases. 
4. A discussion on normalization. 

## Repository Content

- This README file
- A sub-folder `project_mongo` containing the MongoDb queries together with some comments in a Markdown file
- A sub-folder `project_sql` containing the MySQL queries and some comments in a Markdown file.
- A sub-folder `py_app` containing the Python code for the Python application. 
  1. `menu.py` contains the main menu for the application to interface with both the MySQL database and the MongoDb database.
  2. `mongo_connect.py` a module for connecting to the MongoDb database using the `pymongo` module.
  3. `mysql_connect.py` a module for connecting to the MySQL database using the `pymysql` module.

- The final project specification PDF file
- A PDF file and a notebook containing the question relating to database design and normalization.
